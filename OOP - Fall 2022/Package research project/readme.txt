For this project, we(Shyam Patel and Yash Parekh) chose TextBlob. As you can see, TextBlob processes text-based data. It offers a straightforward API for exploring popular NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more. It contains specific predetermined guidelines or a word and weight dictionary, which has some scores that assist in determining the polarity of a statement. Twitter tweets can be translated and determine if the tweets were positive or negative towards someone, which is fascinating to us. 

To install TextBlob, everything should be up to date like all of the python programs, which helps with any problems caused while installing TextBlob and running it. Also, you should check if your pip is up to date with the latest pip3. You can check this by putting py -m pip in the terminal; in the output, you will see if you have it installed. After everything is up to date, we can start installing the package by putting pip install -U textblob and python -m textblob.download_corpora in the terminal, which will take a few seconds. You are ready to code if any error doesn’t pop up.  

Our code lets the user put in a text in the demofile, which can analyze the text and gives the user review of his text. In line 18, print(blob.sentiment)calculates the sentiment of polarity and subjectivity to show if the text in the demofile is negative, positive, or unbiased. The sentiment of polarity calculates the score from [-1.0, 1.0]. Whereas the sentiment of subjectivity is scored from [0.0, 1.0]. In subjectivity, 0.0 means it’s less subjective, and 1.0 means it’s more subjective. In lines 14-16, this line of code provides in-depth analyses and gives polarity numbers like 0.0 or 1.0 to each sentence in the demofile. To show if all of the sentences in the text are negative or have some positivity in some sentences. In lines 20 and 21, it finds valuable words that help show whether the text is negative or positive.

In the future, we would like to add articles that can be translated into other languages. Also, we would like to add more trustworthy resources like textbooks and articles that have good primary source, which has a more positive polarity score.
