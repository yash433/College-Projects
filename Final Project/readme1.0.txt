For this project, we(Shyam Patel and Yash Parekh) chose TextBlob. As you can see, TextBlob processes text-based data. It offers a straightforward API for exploring popular NLP tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more. It contains specific predetermined guidelines or a word and weight dictionary, which has some scores that assist in determining the polarity of a statement. Twitter tweets can be translated and determine if the tweets were positive or negative towards someone, which is fascinating to us. 

To install TextBlob, everything should be up to date like all of the python programs, which helps with any problems caused while installing TextBlob and running it. Also, you should check if your pip is up to date with the latest pip3. You can check this by putting py -m pip in the terminal; in the output, you will see if you have it installed. After everything is up to date, we can start installing the package by putting pip install -U textblob and python -m textblob.download_corpora in the terminal, which will take a few seconds. You are ready to code if any error doesnâ€™t pop up. Also, Our code for translating the text gives us error.
